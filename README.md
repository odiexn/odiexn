- 👋 Hi, I’m @odiexn
- 👀 I’m interested in Cisco Collaboration automation, specifically APIs on CUCM, CUX, UCCX, Expressway and WebEx.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript and Flask. Also studying to take the Cisco CLAUTO exam for my CCNP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of the above.
